            Step aside, chicken noodle soup. If you’re looking for a hearty, healthy dinner, you’ve come to the right place! Not only is this one-pot meal easy to prepare, it also tastes like it’s been
            simmering on the stove for hours… even though it only takes 45 minutes from start to finish. Cooking the chicken in the stew means that it releases all its juices into the broth as it cooks, 
            giving the stew a ton of extra flavor. After that, all you need is a piece of homemade bread for dipping!
